  <h2 id="Top">History of MacRitchie Reservoir</h2>
 
  <p>MacRitchie Reservoir is Singapore's oldest and largest reservoir. Part of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, this gem is fringed by some of the last bits of Singapore's primary forest, and the surrounding greenery is home to some endangered species of plants and birds.</p>

  <p>Completed in 1867, MacRitchie Reservoir, situated off Lornie Road, was the first water supply system in Singapore. The construction of the reservoir came after the British realised Singapore's demand for fresh water rose. This was due to the large number of immigrants and traders settling in Singapore.</p>

  <p>The reservoir park now is used for a multitude of activities and events, such as water sport races and cross country running races. This park has also been a popular spot for nature lovers for many years since its conception.</p>

<h4>The tomb of Lim Bo Seng</h4>

<p>Lim Bo Seng, one of Singapore's war heroes of World War Two, is buried at MacRitchie Reservoir Park.</p>
<p>During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Lim was active in the Nanyang Federation’s resistance activities. On 1 February 1942, Lim and other Chinese community leaders left Singapore for India where they recruited and trained hundreds of secret agents, mainly Malayan Chinese, for the Sino-British guerrilla group, Force 136.</p>
<p>Lim was captured by the Japanese on 25 March 1944 and taken to the Kempeitai headquarters for interrogation. He was subsequently imprisoned at Batu Gajah Gaol in Perak. Refusing to divulge information to the Japanese, he was tortured and eventually fell ill with dysentery. Lim died on 29 June 1944. On 13 January 1946, Lim’s remains were brought to MacRitchie Reservoir where he was buried with full military honours.</p>

<p>Visitors to the Park can visit his tomb at the hilltop beside the start of the Lornie Trail. Click the images below for directions to the Lim Bo Seng Memorial Tomb and Force 136 Historic Marker.</p>
